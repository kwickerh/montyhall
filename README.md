# montyhall
 "The package runs 100 simulations of the Monty Hall problem. It first goes through the five steps to model the problem in R, runs through a single simulation of the game, and then utilizes a for loop to run through 100 simulations. It ultimately will identify how many wins "and losses occur with each strategy of the game (stay or switch)."
